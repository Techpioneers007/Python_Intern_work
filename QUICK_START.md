## 💡 Tips for Best Experience

### General Tips

- All projects have interactive menus - just follow the prompts
- Data is automatically saved (for projects with persistence)
- Use `Ctrl+C` to exit gracefully at any time
- Read the on-screen instructions carefully

### For Data Persistence Projects

- Data files (`.json`, `.csv`) are created automatically
- **Student Report**: Creates `students_data.json`
- **Employee System**: Creates `employees_data.json`
- **Quiz**: Creates `quiz_stats.json`
- **Export files**: Timestamped CSV files created on export

### Troubleshooting

- **"Module not found"**: No external modules needed!
- **"Permission denied"**: Run from project root directory
- **"File not found"**: Use correct relative paths from root
